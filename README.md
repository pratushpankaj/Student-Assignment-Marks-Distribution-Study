# Student Assignment Marks Distribution Study

## Overview
This project analyzes student assignment marks using basic statistical techniques.  
It focuses on understanding **score distribution**, **student performance**, and **grading fairness** through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

This project is created as part of **Minor 1 – Statistics**.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of assignment marks  
- Calculate **mean** and **standard deviation**  
- Visualize data using **histograms**  
- Study grading fairness and assignment difficulty  

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of assignment scores obtained by students in a class.  
The data is used only for academic and analytical purposes.

*(You can place your dataset in the `data/` folder.)*

---

## Statistical Analysis
- **Mean**: Measures the average performance of students  
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures variation in scores  
- **Histogram**: Shows the distribution pattern of marks  

---

## Grading Fairness
- Balanced distribution indicates fair grading  
- Very high or low clustering may indicate assignment difficulty  
- Standard deviation helps identify consistency in evaluation  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
*(or Excel / manual calculations)*
